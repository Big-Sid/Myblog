In this experiment, the main implementation is to deploy the game in lab2 to the cell phone and control the movement of the object through the sensor of the cell phone to achieve the purpose of the game

## 1. Deploying games to cell phones
In order to deploy the unity game to cell phones, you first need to set the unity environment to the cell phone's environment, I used the hand on the iphone, so I used the ios environment, in order to adapt to the phone's input, I changed the player's input setting to mobile input, and then used the gas pedal in the script to control the movement of the object.
Here is a picture of the game deployed to the phoneï¼š

Likewise there is video of the game being played at:


## 2. Problem I met durng this lab 
The problems I encountered in this lab mainly came from the cell phone system, because the iphone is difficult to adapt, especially xcode, in xcode you need to register an Apple developer account to develop and test, here I was stuck for a long time, and finally solved by creating an Apple developer account
