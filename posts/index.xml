1. Create the Game Link to heading First I created a sphere to be the player, then a plane to be the ground, and four cubes to be the walls, and then created different materials for them to be their colors,Also, on the playfield I created 12 small cubes as game objects, and in groups of 6, each group is a different color, the final scene is shown below:</description></item><item><title>HCI Lab3 - Deploy The Unity Game on Phone</title><link>https://Big-Sid.github.io/Myblog/posts/hci-lab3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Big-Sid.github.io/Myblog/posts/hci-lab3/</guid><description>In this experiment, the main implementation is to deploy the game in lab2 to the cell phone and control the movement of the object through the sensor of the cell phone to achieve the purpose of the game
